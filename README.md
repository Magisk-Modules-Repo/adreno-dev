### Description
For use with Qualcomm's official updated preview GPU drivers packages for Adreno 3xx/4xx-powered Nexus stock images. This is a different frontend to take whatever device zip from Qualcomm is in the same directory as it (also searching /sdcard), then unpack and install it as a Magisk module or into the SuperSU systemless root /su filesystem, instead of the usual /system.

*Note:* Magisk module version is populated at flash time by the Adreno GPU driver zip revision
